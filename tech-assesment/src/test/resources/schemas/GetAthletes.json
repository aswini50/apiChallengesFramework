		"bio": "Arianna Fontana OMRI (born April 14, 1990) is an Italian short track speed skater, who has won eight Olympic medals, among these a gold in the 500m short track at the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang. Her medal haul following the 2018 Games made her the female short track skater with the most Olympic medals, and tied her with male skaters Apolo Ohno and Viktor An. It also made her the Italian sportswoman with the second highest number of Winter Olympic medals, behind Stefania Belmondo. She specialises in the 500 m event. She is nicknamed La Freccia Bionda (The Blonde Arrow).\n\nBiography\n=======\nFontana started skating at the age of four, following in the footsteps of her brother Alessandro, initially on roller skates before switching to ice skating. She first trained in Lanzada until the rink there closed, when she switched her training base to Bormio.\n\nFontana made her international championship debut at the 2006 European Short Track Speed Skating Championships in Krynica-Zdrój, where she took the overall silver medal. At the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin, she won bronze in the 3000 m relay. She placed 11th in the 500m and 6th in the 1000 m. The relay medal was the first for Italy in short track speed skating: at 15 years of age, Fontana became the youngest Italian to win a Winter Olympic medal. Following the 2006 Games, Fontana and her relay team-mates were appointed Knights of the Order of Merit of the Italian Republic.\n\nAt the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, she won a bronze medal in the 500 metre event, was eliminated in the semifinals of the 1500 metre event, and was eliminated in the quarterfinals of the 1000 metre event. Her 500m bronze made her the first Italian to take an individual Olympic medal in short track.\n\nFontano began dating Italian-American skater Anthony Lobello Jr. in 2012: the couple were engaged the following year and married in May 2014 in Colico. The couple split their time between homes in Valtellina, Courmayeur and Tallahassee, Florida.\n\nAt the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, she was upgraded from a bronze to a silver medal in the 500 m event after colliding with British skater Elise Christie. Christie was disqualified after causing a crash in the final. She won a bronze medal in the 1500 m event and in the Team-event, and was disqualified in the 1000 m event. Following the Games, Lobello began coaching Fontana following his retirement from competition. The following year Fontana took her first title at the World Short Track Speed Skating Championships, winning the gold in the 1500m and taking the overall silver.\n\nIn October 2017, Fontana was named as Italy's flag bearer for the opening ceremony of the 2018 Winter Olympics in PyeongChang, South Korea. She was the first short track skater to be selected as flag bearer for the Italian Olympic team and the second flag bearer from the Italian Ice Sports Federation, after Carolina Kostner. She won her first Olympic gold medal there, in the 500 m event.She was the first European to win a 500 m Olympic gold. She also won silver in the team event and bronze in the 1000 m event, becoming the woman with most medals in the sport. It also meant that she had won Olympic medals at every contested distance.",

At the 1991  [World Indoor Championships](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1991_IAAF_World_Indoor_Championships \"1991 IAAF World Indoor Championships\")  in  [Seville](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seville \"Seville\"), Cacho finished again second in the 1500 m, behind  [Noureddine Morceli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noureddine_Morceli \"Noureddine Morceli\").\n\nAt the  [Olympic Games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games \"Olympic Games\")  in  [Barcelona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona \"Barcelona\"), Cacho was not considered a serious gold medal threat. But the Olympic 1500 m final was run at a very pedestrian pace, and Cacho positioned himself perfectly in the final lap, and outsprinted his rivals, with an unprecedented last lap of 50.6 seconds, to win the  [gold medal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal \"Gold medal\")  in 3:40.12.\n\nIn 1993 at  [Stuttgart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuttgart \"Stuttgart\")  in  [World Championships](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1993_World_Championships_in_Athletics \"1993 World Championships in Athletics\"), Cacho finished second, but took the 1500 m title at the  [European Championships](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1994_European_Championships_in_Athletics#Track \"1994 European Championships in Athletics\")  in  [Helsinki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helsinki \"Helsinki\")  in the next year. In  [World Championships](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1995_World_Championships_in_Athletics \"1995 World Championships in Athletics\")  at  [Gothenburg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gothenburg \"Gothenburg\"), Cacho only finished in eighth place.\n\nAfter a relatively lean year in 1995, Cacho was back to his best in the early part of the 1996 season, leading up to the  [Olympic Games in Atlanta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1996_Summer_Olympics \"1996 Summer Olympics\"). Although Cacho was the defending  [Olympic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games \"Olympic Games\")  1500 m champion, the final in  [Atlanta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta,_Georgia \"Atlanta, Georgia\")  was considered to be a match race between Morceli and  [Hicham El Guerrouj](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hicham_El_Guerrouj \"Hicham El Guerrouj\"), who had filled the first two places at the previous year's World Championships. Approaching the completion of the third lap, Morceli was leading from El Guerrouj, when suddenly the Moroccan tripped and fell. In taking evasive action, Cacho was forced to leap over the fallen El Guerrouj, in a manoeuvre which he later estimated had lost him 5 metres of ground to Morceli, who had commenced his final lap sprint for the finish. Cacho chased Morceli around the last lap, but was unable to catch him. In the end Morceli won by 5 metres from the second-placed Cacho.\n\nAt the  [World Championships](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1997_World_Championships_in_Athletics \"1997 World Championships in Athletics\")  in  [Athens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athens \"Athens\")  in 1997, Cacho won a  [silver medal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_medal \"Silver medal\")  again, and at the end of the same season he finally managed to run his world class time, when he finished second at the 1500 m behind El Guerrouj with a time of 3:28.95, which moved him to third on the all-time world list behind Morceli and El Guerrouj. He won the  [bronze medal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal \"Bronze medal\")  at the  [1998 European Championships](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1998_European_Championships_in_Athletics#Track \"1998 European Championships in Athletics\")  in  [Budapest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budapest \"Budapest\"), and finished fourth in the  [World Championships](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1999_World_Championships_in_Athletics \"1999 World Championships in Athletics\")  at Seville in 1999. Cacho suffered an  [Achilles' tendon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achilles%27_tendon \"Achilles' tendon\")  injury in 2000, causing him to miss the opportunity to add to his Olympic gold and silver medals at  [2000 Summer Olympics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000_Summer_Olympics \"2000 Summer Olympics\")  in  [Sydney](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney \"Sydney\").\n\nHe held the  [European record](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_European_records_in_athletics \"List of European records in athletics\")  at 1500 m with a time of 3:28.95 for 16 years (1997–2013), until  [Mo Farah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mo_Farah \"Mo Farah\")  broke it with a time of 3:28.81.",

She ran under the 11-second barrier over 30 times and was the first to run under 11 seconds in an Olympic Games.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evelyn_Ashford#cite_note-sports-reference.com-2)\n\nAs a 19-year-old, Ashford finished 5th in the 100 m event at the  [1976 Summer Olympics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1976_Summer_Olympics \"1976 Summer Olympics\"). After beating the World Record holders in the 100 m and 200 m in 1979 at the World Cup of Track and Field in Montreal, Ashford was one of the potential medalists for the  [1980 Summer Olympics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1980_Summer_Olympics \"1980 Summer Olympics\"), but these Games were  [boycotted by the United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1980_Summer_Olympics_boycott \"1980 Summer Olympics boycott\"). Evelyn also tore a quad muscle in May, and was out for the rest of the season.\n\nAshford was ranked No. 1 in the world by  _[Track & Field News](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_%26_Field_News \"Track & Field News\")_  over 100 metres in 1979 and 1981,[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evelyn_Ashford#cite_note-T&FN100-3)  and over 200 metres in 1981.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evelyn_Ashford#cite_note-T&FN200-4)  She also was named Track and Field News \"Athlete of the Year\" twice, in 1981 and 1984[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evelyn_Ashford#cite_note-5)\n\nShe would again win the sprint double, at the World Cup of Track and Field in Rome, in 1981.\n\nOn July 3, 1983, she set her first World Record (be it at altitude) for the 100 metres, running 10.79 seconds at the National Sports Festival in  [Colorado Springs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Springs,_Colorado \"Colorado Springs, Colorado\"),  [Colorado](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado \"Colorado\")  and was one of the favourites to win the 100 metre title at the  [inaugural World Championships](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1983_World_Championships_in_Athletics \"1983 World Championships in Athletics\")  in  [Helsinki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helsinki \"Helsinki\"). In the final, however, she pulled a  [hamstring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamstring \"Hamstring\")  muscle and fell. The other main favourite,  [Marlies Göhr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marlies_G%C3%B6hr \"Marlies Göhr\")  of  [East Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Germany \"East Germany\")  (who had already beaten Ashford earlier that year) went on to win.\n\nAt the  [1984 Summer Olympics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1984_Summer_Olympics \"1984 Summer Olympics\"), Ashford had a chance to win a gold medal. However, she had to withdraw from the 200 m heats with a minor injury. She competed in the  [100 m](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athletics_at_the_1984_Summer_Olympics_%E2%80%93_Women%27s_100_metres \"Athletics at the 1984 Summer Olympics – Women's 100 metres\"), winning the event in a new Olympic Record of 10.97 secs. As the anchor runner for 4 × 100 m relay team, she won a second gold medal. In the absence of World Champions and world record holders East Germany, the US team clocked one of the fastest times in history and won by the biggest margin ever at an Olympics, 1.12 seconds.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evelyn_Ashford#cite_note-sports-reference.com-2)\n\nLater in the season, she finally defeated her main rival Göhr at the  [Weltklasse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weltklasse \"Weltklasse\")  meeting in  [Zürich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z%C3%BCrich \"Zürich\"),  [Switzerland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland \"Switzerland\"). The race saw Ashford make up half a metre or so over Göhr and lower her own World Record to 10.76 secs.  [See the race](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Mdu3fQXBUE)  on  [YouTube](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube \"YouTube\")  That race proved to be Ashford's personal record. It still ranks as the No. 8 Individual all-time[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evelyn_Ashford#cite_note-6)  Ashford, unsurprisingly, regained her No. 1  _Track & Field News_  ranking.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evelyn_Ashford#cite_note-T&FN100-3)\n\nAt the  [1988 Summer Olympics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1988_Summer_Olympics \"1988 Summer Olympics\"), she was the flag bearer for the United States team at the Opening Ceremony. She was beaten in the 100 m by  [Florence Griffith Joyner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florence_Griffith_Joyner \"Florence Griffith Joyner\"), who had broken her World Record earlier in the season at the  [Olympic Trials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1988_United_States_Olympic_Trials_(track_and_field) \"1988 United States Olympic Trials (track and field)\"). In the  [4 × 100 m relay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athletics_at_the_1988_Summer_Olympics_%E2%80%93_Women%27s_4_x_100_metre_relay \"Athletics at the 1988 Summer Olympics – Women's 4 x 100 metre relay\")  she again ran the final leg, winning her third Olympic gold medal despite a less than perfect last exchange between Griffith-Joyner and Ashford that required Ashford to run a sensational final leg to overtake Göhr.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evelyn_Ashford#cite_note-sports-reference.com-2)\n\nAt her  [last Olympics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1992_Summer_Olympics \"1992 Summer Olympics\")  in  [Barcelona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona \"Barcelona\"), Ashford, aged 35, was eliminated in the 100 m semi-finals by 1/100th of a second; she went on to win her third straight Olympic 4 × 100 m relay gold, this time running 1st leg. She is one of only six women to have won four gold medals in track and field Olympic history.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evelyn_Ashford#cite_note-sports-reference.com-2)\n\nAshford came back from season ending injuries three times, to reach the top of the sport in the following year. In 1980 she injured her quad, and returned in 1981 with the sprint double at the World Cup and the number one world ranking in both sprints. After an injury in 1983, she became double Olympic Champion in 1984. In 1987 a hamstring pull prevented her from competing at the World Championships, then a season later added an Olympic Silver and third Gold medal to her collection.\n\nOn May 30, 1985 she gave birth to her daughter Raina Ashley Washington, and again came back for an excellent 1986, losing only once over both the 100 m and 200 m, and winning the 100 meter title at the Goodwill Games; earning another No. 1 ranking by  _Track & Field News_  over the shorter distance.\n\nAfter parting ways with her coach  [Pat Connolly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Winslow \"Pat Winslow\")  (herself a 3-time Olympian) in 1985, Ashford was largely self-coached.\n\nIn 1997, Ashford was inducted into the  [National Track and Field Hall of Fame](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Track_and_Field_Hall_of_Fame \"National Track and Field Hall of Fame\"),[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evelyn_Ashford#cite_note-7)  where she is said to be \"one of the greatest track and field runners ever.\" Ashford went to the  [University of California, Los Angeles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California,_Los_Angeles \"University of California, Los Angeles\")  and  [Roseville High School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roseville_High_School_(Roseville,_California) \"Roseville High School (Roseville, California)\").

A two-time  [Olympic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games \"Olympic Games\")  champion in the 100 meters for the  [USA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Olympic_Team \"United States Olympic Team\"), her 1996 win made her only the second woman (after  [Wyomia Tyus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wyomia_Tyus \"Wyomia Tyus\")) to successfully defend an Olympic 100m title. She won a third Olympic gold medal in the 4 × 100 m relay in 1996. She is also the  [1993 World champion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1993_World_Championships_in_Athletics \"1993 World Championships in Athletics\")  in the 100m and a three-time  [World champion in the 100m hurdles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_World_Championships_in_Athletics_medalists_(women) \"List of World Championships in Athletics medalists (women)\"). In 2011, she was inducted into the  [National Track and Field Hall of Fame](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Track_and_Field_Hall_of_Fame \"National Track and Field Hall of Fame\").\n\n## Life and career\n\nDevers was born in  [Seattle, Washington](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle,_Washington \"Seattle, Washington\"), and grew up near  [National City, California](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_City,_California \"National City, California\"), graduating from  [Sweetwater High School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweetwater_High_School_(National_City,_California) \"Sweetwater High School (National City, California)\")  in 1984.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gail_Devers#cite_note-usatf.org-1)  (Sweetwater's football and track stadium would later be named Gail Devers Stadium.) A young talent in the  [100 m](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres \"100 metres\")  and  [100 m hurdles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres_hurdles \"100 metres hurdles\"), Devers was in training for the  [1988 Summer Olympics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1988_Summer_Olympics \"1988 Summer Olympics\"), started experiencing health problems, suffering from among others  [migraine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Migraine \"Migraine\")  and vision loss. She qualified for the Olympics 100 m hurdles, in which she was eliminated in the semi-finals, but her health continued to deteriorate even further.\n\nIn 1990, she was diagnosed with  [Graves' disease](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graves-Basedow_disease \"Graves-Basedow disease\")  and underwent  [radioactive iodine treatment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iodine-131 \"Iodine-131\")  followed by  [thyroid hormone replacement therapy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levothyroxine \"Levothyroxine\"). During her radiation treatment, Devers began to develop blistering and swelling of her feet. Eventually, the sprinter could barely walk and had to crawl and or be carried. A doctor considered amputating her feet. Amazingly, Devers recovered after the radiation treatment was discontinued, and she resumed training. At the 1991 World Championships, she won a  [silver medal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_medal \"Silver medal\")  in the 100 m hurdles.\n\nAt the  [1992 Summer Olympics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1992_Summer_Olympics \"1992 Summer Olympics\"), Devers starred. She qualified for the final of the 100 m, which ended in an exciting finish, with five women finishing close (within 0.06 seconds). The  [photo finish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photo_finish \"Photo finish\")  showed Devers had narrowly beaten  [Jamaican](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaica \"Jamaica\")  [Juliet Cuthbert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juliet_Cuthbert \"Juliet Cuthbert\"). In the final of the 100 m hurdles, Devers' lead event, she seemed to be running towards a second  [gold medal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal \"Gold medal\"), when she hit the final hurdle and stumbled over the finish line in fifth place, leaving  [Voula Patoulidou](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voula_Patoulidou \"Voula Patoulidou\")  from  [Greece](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greece \"Greece\")  as the upset winner.\n\nIn 1993, Devers won the 100 m World Championship title after - again - a photo finish win over  [Merlene Ottey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merlene_Ottey \"Merlene Ottey\")  in an apparent dead heat, and the 100 m hurdles title. She retained her hurdles title in 1995.\n\nThe 100 m final at the  [1996 Summer Olympics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1996_Summer_Olympics \"1996 Summer Olympics\")  was an almost exact repeat of the World Championships final three years before. Ottey and Devers again finished in the same time and did not know who had won the race. Again, both were awarded the same time of 10.94 seconds, but Devers was judged to have finished first and became the first woman to retain the Olympic 100 m title since  [Wyomia Tyus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wyomia_Tyus \"Wyomia Tyus\").  [Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shelly-Ann_Fraser-Pryce \"Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce\")  duplicated the feat in 2012. In the final of her favorite event, Devers again failed, as she finished fourth and outside of the medals. With the  [4 × 100 m relay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4_x_100_metres_relay \"4 x 100 metres relay\")  team, Devers won her third Olympic gold medal.\n\nAfter these Olympics, Devers concentrated on the hurdles event, winning the World Championship again in 1999, but she had to forfeit for the semi-finals at the  [2000 Summer Olympics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000_Summer_Olympics \"2000 Summer Olympics\").\n\nDevers competed in the 100 m and 100 m hurdles at the  [2004 Summer Olympics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2004_Summer_Olympics \"2004 Summer Olympics\")  in Athens, her fifth Olympic Games.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gail_Devers#cite_note-3)\n\nDevers left competition in 2005 to give birth to a child with her husband and returned in 2006.\n\nOn February 2, 2007, at the age of 40, Devers edged 2004 Olympic champion  [Joanna Hayes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joanna_Hayes \"Joanna Hayes\")  to win the  [60 m hurdles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/60_metres_hurdles \"60 metres hurdles\")  event at the  [Millrose Games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millrose_Games \"Millrose Games\")  in 7.86 seconds - the best time in the world that season and just 0.12 off the record she set in 2003. Furthermore, the time bettered the listed World Record for a 40-year-old by almost 7 tenths of a second.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gail_Devers#cite_note-4)\n\nDuring her career, Devers was notable for having exceptionally long, heavily decorated fingernails. One of the fastest starters in the world, Devers even had to alter her starting position to accommodate her long nails.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gail_Devers#cite_note-5)  Her long nails came as the result of a contest her father devised to get her to stop biting her nails as a child.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gail_Devers#cite_note-6)\n\nDevers' brother was  [IFBB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Federation_of_BodyBuilding_%26_Fitness \"International Federation of BodyBuilding & Fitness\")  Professional  [Bodybuilder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bodybuilder \"Bodybuilder\")  Parenthesis \"PD\" Devers.\n\n## Achievements and recognition\n\nIn 2011, she was elected into the  [National Track and Field Hall of Fame](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Track_and_Field_Hall_of_Fame \"National Track and Field Hall of Fame\"). The following year she was elected into the  [United States Olympic Hall of Fame](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Olympic_Hall_of_Fame \"United States Olympic Hall of Fame\").[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gail_Devers#cite_note-7)  In November 2012, Devers was announced as a 2013 recipient of the  [NCAA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Collegiate_Athletic_Association \"National Collegiate Athletic Association\")  [Silver Anniversary Award](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_Anniversary_Awards_(NCAA) \"Silver Anniversary Awards (NCAA)\"), presented annually to six distinguished former college student-athletes on the 25th anniversary of the end of their college sports careers.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gail_Devers#cite_note-8)",

		"bio": "\n**Simon St. Quentin Whitfield**  (born 16 May 1975 in  [Kingston, Ontario](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingston,_Ontario \"Kingston, Ontario\")) is a retired  [Olympic triathlon champion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Olympic_medalists_in_triathlon \"List of Olympic medalists in triathlon\")  from Canada. Whitfield won 10 consecutive Canadian Triathlon Championships titles and  [carried the Canadian national flag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_flag_bearers_for_Canada_at_the_Olympics \"List of flag bearers for Canada at the Olympics\")  during the  [2000 Summer Olympics closing ceremony](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000_Summer_Olympics_closing_ceremony \"2000 Summer Olympics closing ceremony\")  in Sydney, where he had won his gold medal, and the opening ceremony at the  [2012 Summer Olympics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Summer_Olympics \"2012 Summer Olympics\")  in London, making him one of few Canadian athletes to be honoured twice as Olympic flag bearer.\n\n\n## Biography\n\nAs a young boy, Whitfield played  [soccer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soccer \"Soccer\"), until he began with  [triathlon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triathlon \"Triathlon\")  at age 11, honing his early competitive skills in the Canadian  _Kids of Steel_  program. By age 15, he was pursuing triathlon on a serious competitive basis. At present, Whitfield lives in  [Victoria, British Columbia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria,_British_Columbia \"Victoria, British Columbia\")  and maintains his second residence at  [Salt Spring Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_Spring_Island \"Salt Spring Island\").\n\n### Triathlon career\n\nWhitfield won a gold medal in the triathlon at the  [2000 Summer Olympics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000_Summer_Olympics \"2000 Summer Olympics\")  in  [Sydney](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney \"Sydney\"), Australia. He got up off the ground after he and 14 other riders crashed in the bike race portion of the event and worked his way back near the leaders. In the foot race, he cut down the field one at a time then put on a finishing kick to take the victory. His final time was 1:48:24.02, which until 2012 stood as the fastest Olympic triathlon.\n\nIn the  [2002 Commonwealth Games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2002_Commonwealth_Games \"2002 Commonwealth Games\")  in  [Manchester](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester \"Manchester\"), England he claimed gold again. He ended up in 11th place at the  [2004 Summer Olympics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2004_Summer_Olympics \"2004 Summer Olympics\")  with a time of 1:53:15.81.\n\nWhitfield was named to the  [2008 Summer Olympics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_Summer_Olympics \"2008 Summer Olympics\")  team and won a silver medal while competing at his third consecutive games.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_Whitfield#cite_note-Triathlon-2)  With a time of 1:48:58, he finished 5 seconds behind the German gold medalist.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_Whitfield#cite_note-3)  Whitfield's accomplishment was made even more impressive considering he was a distant fourth behind the lead three runners heading into the final kilometre of the run before he burst forth into the lead with 200 metres remaining. Whitfield, exhausted by his effort to get back into the lead, was then passed by the eventual winner  [Jan Frodeno](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jan_Frodeno \"Jan Frodeno\")  of Germany at the end of the race.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_Whitfield#cite_note-4)\n\n[![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fa/Simon_Whitfield_with_flag.jpg/170px-Simon_Whitfield_with_flag.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Simon_Whitfield_with_flag.jpg)\n\nWhitfield as flag bearer at the  [2012 Olympic Opening Ceremonies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada_at_the_2012_Summer_Olympics \"Canada at the 2012 Summer Olympics\")\n\nWhitfield competed at the  [2012 London Olympics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_London_Olympics \"2012 London Olympics\")  in Triathlon. After finishing 15th in the swim[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_Whitfield#cite_note-5)  Whitfield was riding out of transition in his aero-bars when he was caught off balance going over a speed bump, falling off of his bike and breaking his collar bone, forcing him to drop out of the race.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_Whitfield#cite_note-6)  Although disappointed, Whitfield remained composed and tactful, apologizing to a fellow athlete who was involved in the crash. Throughout the Olympics Whitfield continued to defend fellow triathlete and Olympic competitor  [Paula Findlay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paula_Findlay \"Paula Findlay\")  from the media when she came last in the women's triathlon in the London games.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_Whitfield#cite_note-7)\n\nWhitfield retired in 2013.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_Whitfield#cite_note-8)\n\n## Awards and honours\n\nIn 2017, Whitfeld was inducted into  [Canada's Sports Hall of Fame](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada%27s_Sports_Hall_of_Fame \"Canada's Sports Hall of Fame\").[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_Whitfield#cite_note-9)",

His wrestling record is 887 wins and two losses.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleksandr_Karelin#cite_note-6)[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleksandr_Karelin#cite_note-7)[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleksandr_Karelin#cite_note-8)  Karelin was the national flag bearer at three consecutive Olympics: in 1988 for the Soviet Union, in 1992 for the  [Unified Team](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Team_at_the_Olympics \"Unified Team at the Olympics\"), and in 1996 for Russia.\n\n## Wrestling career\n\nKarelin was born as a 5.5 kilograms (12 lb) baby.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleksandr_Karelin#cite_note-karelinru2-9)  He began training in 1981, under Viktor Kuznetsov, who remained his coach through his entire career.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleksandr_Karelin#cite_note-iat-10)[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleksandr_Karelin#cite_note-pr-1)  Before that he tried boxing, weightlifting, volleyball, basketball and skiing.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleksandr_Karelin#cite_note-fizvosp-11)  Karelin went undefeated for the first time from 1982 to 1987 and second time from 1987 to 2000. In 1985 he came to international competitions and won a junior world title.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleksandr_Karelin#cite_note-pr-1)  He had his first loss (score 0–1) at the USSR championships in 1987, to the reigning Russian and European champion  [Igor Rostorotsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Igor_Rostorotsky \"Igor Rostorotsky\"); he defeated Rostorotsky at the next USSR championships while recovering from a flu and a recent concussion.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleksandr_Karelin#cite_note-pr-1)\n\nIn the 1988 Olympic final Karelin was losing to  [Rangel Gerovski](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rangel_Gerovski \"Rangel Gerovski\"), but with 15 seconds left managed to execute his favorite  [Karelin Lift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suplex#Karelin_lift \"Suplex\")  and won.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleksandr_Karelin#cite_note-pr-1)  At the 1996 Summer Olympic Games in Atlanta, Karelin faced American  [Matt Ghaffari](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Ghaffari \"Matt Ghaffari\")  for the gold medal. Karelin had come off a shoulder surgery and looked vulnerable against a strong Ghaffari, who was able to repel Karelin's efforts to lift and slam him, forcing Karelin to use all of his skill and experience to defend a 1–0 lead.[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleksandr_Karelin#cite_note-autogenerated2000-12)\n\nAfter going 13 years undefeated in international competition and six years without giving up a point, he lost 0–1 to  [Rulon Gardner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rulon_Gardner \"Rulon Gardner\")  of the  [United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States \"United States\")  in the final of the  [Sydney Olympics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000_Summer_Olympics \"2000 Summer Olympics\").[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleksandr_Karelin#cite_note-Miracle-13)[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleksandr_Karelin#cite_note-14)[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleksandr_Karelin#cite_note-15)  Karelin retired from competitions in 2000.[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleksandr_Karelin#cite_note-16)\n\n### Wrestling style\n\nKarelin was revered for his extraordinary strength and unprecedented success in international competition. He competed at the heaviest weight class of his day, 130 kg (286 lb). His conditioning and quickness combined with his dominance of the sport, led to him being known as \"The Experiment\". When asked why he thought he was called that, Karelin noted that others do not understand because \"I train every day of my life as they have never trained a day in theirs\".[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleksandr_Karelin#cite_note-Winner-17)  His coach was at first skeptical about a big but powerless boy, yet he accepted Karelin and motivated him for hard training, both in wrestling technique and physical strength. As a result, over the years Karelin progressed from 0 to 42  [pull-ups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pull-up_(exercise) \"Pull-up (exercise)\").[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleksandr_Karelin#cite_note-karelinru2-9)[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleksandr_Karelin#cite_note-lift-18)\n\nKarelin was famous for his reverse body lift, the Karelin Lift, where facing the opponent who was lying flat on the mat to keep from being thrown, Karelin hoisted his opponents into the air and slammed them violently to the mat. This devastatingly effective maneuver, when properly executed, awarded Karelin 5 points per throw, the maximum awarded in Greco-Roman wrestling. The throw had long been in use by lighter wrestlers but not by heavyweights – because of the immense strength required to raise, spin and hit the mat with a 560+ lbs combined weight of both athletes (280+ of which resist desperately to the performed manoeuver). Karelin's ability to perform this throw against elite opponents weighing as much as 130 kg amazed other participants and observers of the sport.[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleksandr_Karelin#cite_note-lift-18)  In 889 fights, Karelin used the reverse body lift on circa 800 occasions, in some cases several times per round.[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleksandr_Karelin#cite_note-19)\n\n### Injuries\n\nLike most top wrestlers, Karelin had a number of severe injuries through his career. He credits his fast recoveries to Valery Okhapkin, physician of the national wrestling team, and claims that Okhapkin extended his competition lifetime by several years.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleksandr_Karelin#cite_note-pr-1)\n\nAt the age of 15 Karelin broke his leg while training; having learned about this accident his mother burned his wrestling uniform and forbade him to wrestle. Since then he broke his arms twice and ribs thirteen times. Around January 1988 he had a serious concussion, and doctors considered removing him from the 1988 Olympic team. Karelin won the 1993 World Championships despite breaking two ribs in the opening bout against  [Matt Ghaffari](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Ghaffari \"Matt Ghaffari\"). At the 1996 European Championships in Budapest, he had torn the right chest muscle so badly that doctors predicted he would not be able to use his right hand for several months. Karelin won the Championships, but had to be urgently operated on in Budapest. He recovered within three months to compete at the 1996 Olympics.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleksandr_Karelin#cite_note-pr-1)",

After losing the first set, and facing match point in the decider at 5–6, Murray eventually took the match in a third-set tiebreaker to win his second Miami Masters title, and leapfrog Roger Federer into second place in the rankings, ending a near-decade long time period in which either Federer or Rafael Nadal were ranked in the top two.[[216]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-216)  Murray briefly fell back to No. 3, following a third round defeat by Stanislas Wawrinka in  [Monte-Carlo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013_Monte-Carlo_Rolex_Masters \"2013 Monte-Carlo Rolex Masters\"), but reclaimed the No. 2 ranking as a result of Federer failing to defend his title at the  [Mutua Madrid Open](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013_Mutua_Madrid_Open \"2013 Mutua Madrid Open\"). Later, Murray lost at the quarter-final stage to Tomáš Berdych in straight sets.[[217]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-217)\n\nAt the  [Rome Masters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_Open_(tennis) \"Italian Open (tennis)\"), Murray retired due to a hip injury during his second round match against  [Marcel Granollers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcel_Granollers \"Marcel Granollers\")  on his 26th birthday. Murray had just battled back to tie the match at one set all after winning the second set on a tiebreak. This left Murray with only eleven days to be fit for the start of the  [French Open](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013_French_Open \"2013 French Open\").[[218]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-218)\n\nSpeaking at a press conference after the match, Murray said, \"As it is, I'd be very surprised if I was playing in Paris. I need to make a plan as to what I do. I'll chat with the guys tonight and make a plan for the next few days then make a decision on Paris after the next five days.\"[[219]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-219)  He would go on to withdraw from Roland Garros later, citing a back injury.[[220]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-220)  After a four-week break due to injury, Murray made his comeback at the  [2013 Aegon Championships](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013_Aegon_Championships \"2013 Aegon Championships\"), where he was the top seed. After a rain delayed first day, Murray had to complete his second round match against Nicolas Mahut, and his subsequent match against  [Marinko Matosevic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marinko_Matosevic \"Marinko Matosevic\")  on the same day, both of which he won in straight sets. After beating  [Benjamin Becker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Becker \"Benjamin Becker\")  in the quarter-finals, Murray next faced his first top ten opponent since losing to Tomáš Berdych in Madrid, taking on Jo-Wilfried Tsonga in the semi-finals. After dropping the first set against the Frenchman, Murray eventually raised his level and won in three to set up a final against Marin Čilić of Croatia, his third consecutive final on grass courts. He came from behind again to beat Čilić in three sets to claim his third title at  [Queen's Club](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen%27s_Club_Championships \"Queen's Club Championships\").[[221]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-221)\n\n[![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ad/AndyMurrayWimbledonTrophyCropped.jpg/170px-AndyMurrayWimbledonTrophyCropped.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:AndyMurrayWimbledonTrophyCropped.jpg)\n\nMurray holds the Wimbledon trophy following his victory in the  [2013 men's final](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013_Wimbledon_Championships_%E2%80%93_Men%27s_Singles_final \"2013 Wimbledon Championships – Men's Singles final\")\n\nGoing into Wimbledon, Murray had not lost a match on grass since the previous year's final, and was on a winning streak of 11 matches on grass. In the first two rounds, Murray faced Benjamin Becker[[222]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-222)  and Yen-hsun Lu[[223]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-223)  respectively, defeating both in straight sets. His third round match was against 32nd seed  [Tommy Robredo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommy_Robredo \"Tommy Robredo\"), and despite a tour comeback over the past year, Murray overcame the Spaniard in straight sets to set up a clash with  [Mikhail Youzhny](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Youzhny \"Mikhail Youzhny\"), the highest seed left in Murray's half following the unexpectedly early exits of Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal.[[224]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-224)  Despite facing a fightback in the second set, Murray won in straight sets to make it through to his tenth consecutive Grand Slam quarter-final,[[225]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-225)  in which he was to play Fernando Verdasco, the first left-handed player Murray had faced since the  [2012 US Open](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_US_Open_(tennis) \"2012 US Open (tennis)\"). For the seventh time in his career, Murray had to come back from a deficit of two sets to ultimately come through in five,[[226]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-226)  setting up a semi-final clash with 24th seed  [Jerzy Janowicz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerzy_Janowicz \"Jerzy Janowicz\"), the Polish player who beat Murray in their previous encounter. After Murray failed to break Janowicz's serve, the Pole took the opening set in the tiebreak, following a double fault from Murray. However Murray managed to up his level of play, and won the next three sets, making it through to his second consecutive Wimbledon final, and third consecutive major final against Novak Djokovic.[[227]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-227)\n\nDespite the Serb being the favourite to win the title throughout the Championships, Murray overcame Djokovic in a straight sets match that lasted over three hours, to become the first British winner of the men's singles title since Fred Perry in 1936, the first Scot of either sex to win a Wimbledon singles title since  [Harold Mahony](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harold_Mahony \"Harold Mahony\")  in 1896, and to extend his winning streak on grass to 18 matches.[[228]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-228)\n\nAt the  [US Open](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013_US_Open_%E2%80%93_Men%27s_Singles \"2013 US Open – Men's Singles\"), Murray entered a Grand Slam tournament as defending champion for the first time, and started strongly with a straight sets win against  [Michaël Llodra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micha%C3%ABl_Llodra \"Michaël Llodra\"). He backed this up with wins over  [Leonardo Mayer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonardo_Mayer \"Leonardo Mayer\"), Florian Mayer and  [Denis Istomin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denis_Istomin \"Denis Istomin\")  to reach the quarter-finals at a major for the 11th straight tournament. In the last 8, Murray faced Stanislas Wawrinka of Switzerland, but lost in straight sets, ending Murray's streak of four consecutive major finals.[[229]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-229)  Following his disappointing run of form on hard courts, Murray next joined the  [Great Britain Davis Cup team](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Britain_Davis_Cup_team \"Great Britain Davis Cup team\")  in their  [World Group Play-off](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013_Davis_Cup_World_Group_Play-offs \"2013 Davis Cup World Group Play-offs\")  tie on clay against  [Croatia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croatia_Davis_Cup_team \"Croatia Davis Cup team\"), where he played in two singles and the doubles rubbers. After defeating 16-year-old  [Borna Ćorić](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borna_%C4%86ori%C4%87 \"Borna Ćorić\")  in straight sets, Murray teamed up with  [Colin Fleming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colin_Fleming \"Colin Fleming\")  to defeat Croatian number 1 Ivan Dodig and  [Mate Pavić](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mate_Pavi%C4%87 \"Mate Pavić\")  in the doubles, and take a 2–1 lead in the tie. Murray then sealed Britain's return to the  [World Group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Davis_Cup_World_Group \"2014 Davis Cup World Group\")  by defeating Dodig in straight sets.[[230]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-230)\n\nFollowing the Davis Cup, Murray's season was cut short by his decision to undergo surgery, in order to sort out the lower back problems that had caused him problems since the early stages of the previous season. After being forced to withdraw from the French Open in May, the injury flared up again during the US Open and later during the Davis Cup World Group Play-offs, Murray made the decision that surgery was the best way to sort the problem out for the long-term.[[231]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-231)  Following the conclusion of the 2013 season, Murray was voted the  [2013 BBC Sport Personality of the Year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013_BBC_Sports_Personality_of_the_Year_Award \"2013 BBC Sports Personality of the Year Award\"), after having been heavy favourite since the nominees were announced.[[232]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-232)\n\n### 2014: 30th career title and out of top 10\nMain article:  [2014 Andy Murray tennis season](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Andy_Murray_tennis_season \"2014 Andy Murray tennis season\")\n\nMurray started his  [season](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_ATP_World_Tour \"2014 ATP World Tour\")  at the  [Qatar Open](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Qatar_ExxonMobil_Open \"2014 Qatar ExxonMobil Open\")  in Doha. In the first round, he defeated  [Mousa Shanan Zayed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mousa_Shanan_Zayed \"Mousa Shanan Zayed\")  in straight sets in 37 minutes without dropping a single game, but was defeated in three sets by No. 40 Florian Mayer in the second round, despite being a set and a break up three games into the second set.[[233]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-233)  He then played a warm-up match at the  [2014 AAMI Classic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_AAMI_Classic \"2014 AAMI Classic\")  in Kooyong against No. 43 Lleyton Hewitt, losing in two close tiebreaks.\n\nHe next headed to Melbourne for the  [2014 Australian Open](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Australian_Open_%E2%80%93_Men%27s_Singles \"2014 Australian Open – Men's Singles\"), where he drew the No. 112,  [Go Soeda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_Soeda \"Go Soeda\")  of Japan. Despite worries that he was not match-fit, Murray got off to a strong start, dispatching the Japanese number 2 in under 90 minutes, losing just 5 games in the process. He next went on to defeat  [Vincent Millot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vincent_Millot \"Vincent Millot\")  and Feliciano López respectively in straight sets. In the fourth round, Murray dropped his first set of the tournament on his way to beating  [Stephane Robert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephane_Robert \"Stephane Robert\")  in four sets to set up a meeting with long-standing rival Roger Federer in the quarter-finals. Despite saving two match points to take the third set, he ultimately went out in four, ending his streak of four consecutive Australian Open semi-finals.[[234]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-234)  As a result of losing before the final, Murray fell to No. 6, falling out of the top 5 for the first time since 2008.\n\nHe next headed to the United States to compete in the  [Davis Cup World Group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Davis_Cup_World_Group#United_States_vs._Great_Britain \"2014 Davis Cup World Group\")  first round with  [Great Britain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Britain_Davis_Cup_team \"Great Britain Davis Cup team\"), who went into the tie as outsiders. Murray won both of his ties against  [Donald Young](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Young_(tennis) \"Donald Young (tennis)\")  and Sam Querrey respectively, helping Britain to their first Davis Cup quarter-final since 1986.[[235]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-235)  Murray's next tournament was the  [Rotterdam Open](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_ABN_AMRO_World_Tennis_Tournament \"2014 ABN AMRO World Tennis Tournament\")  after receiving a late wild card, however he lost to Marin Čilić in straight sets in the quarter-finals. His following competition, the  [Mexican Open](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Abierto_Mexicano_Telcel \"2014 Abierto Mexicano Telcel\")  in Acapulco, ended in a semi-final defeat by Grigor Dimitrov in a thrilling three-setter that required two tiebreakers to decide the final two sets.\n\nAt  [Indian Wells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_BNP_Paribas_Open_%E2%80%93_Men%27s_Singles#Section_2 \"2014 BNP Paribas Open – Men's Singles\"), Murray struggled in his first two matches against  [Lukáš Rosol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luk%C3%A1%C5%A1_Rosol \"Lukáš Rosol\")  and  [Jiří Veselý](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ji%C5%99%C3%AD_Vesel%C3%BD \"Jiří Veselý\")  respectively, overcoming both in close three-set encounters to set up a fourth round clash with Canadian Milos Raonic, which he lost in three sets. Murray offered to play with  [2012 Wimbledon Doubles champion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Wimbledon_Championships_%E2%80%93_Men%27s_Doubles#Finals \"2012 Wimbledon Championships – Men's Doubles\")  [Jonathan Marray](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Marray \"Jonathan Marray\"), because Marray was unable to convince anyone to join him on court.[[236]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-Wimbledon_2014:_Jonny_Marray's_doubles_trouble_ends_in_win_as_he_makes_second_round_with_John-Patrick_Smith-236)  For Murray and Marray's first competitive match together, they won a doubles clash against  [Gaël Monfils](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ga%C3%ABl_Monfils \"Gaël Monfils\")  and  [Juan Mónaco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_M%C3%B3naco \"Juan Mónaco\")  only to lose in the  [second round](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_BNP_Paribas_Open_%E2%80%93_Men%27s_Doubles#Bottom_half \"2014 BNP Paribas Open – Men's Doubles\")  to the No 2 seeds  [Alexander Peya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Peya \"Alexander Peya\")  and  [Bruno Soares](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruno_Soares \"Bruno Soares\").\n\nIn March, Murray split with coach Ivan Lendl, who had been widely praised for helping Murray achieve his goal of winning Grand Slam titles.[[237]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-237)  At the  [2014 Miami Masters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Miami_Masters \"2014 Miami Masters\"), Murray defeated  [Matthew Ebden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Ebden \"Matthew Ebden\"), Feliciano López and Jo Wilfried Tsonga but lost to Djokovic in the quarter-finals.[[238]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-238)  In the  [Davis Cup quarter-finals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Davis_Cup_World_Group#Italy_vs._Great_Britain \"2014 Davis Cup World Group\")  against Italy, he beat  [Andreas Seppi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andreas_Seppi \"Andreas Seppi\")  in his first rubber, then teamed up with Colin Fleming to win the doubles rubber. Murray had only beaten one top ten player on clay, Nikolay Davydenko, back in 2009, and so in his final singles match, was stunned by  [Fabio Fognini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fabio_Fognini \"Fabio Fognini\")  in straight sets, which took Great Britain to the deciding final rubber.[[239]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-Davis_2014_Out-239)  However, in this match his compatriot,  [James Ward](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Ward_(tennis) \"James Ward (tennis)\")  was defeated by Andreas Seppi, also in straight sets, knocking Murray and Great Britain out of the Davis Cup.[[239]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-Davis_2014_Out-239)\n\nMurray next competed at the  [Madrid Open](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Mutua_Madrid_Open \"2014 Mutua Madrid Open\")  and following his opening win, over Nicolas Almagro, he dedicated the victory to former player  [Elena Baltacha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elena_Baltacha \"Elena Baltacha\").[[240]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-240)[[241]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-241)  He then lost to qualifier  [Santiago Giraldo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santiago_Giraldo \"Santiago Giraldo\")  in the following round. Murray then reached the quarter-finals of the  [Rome Masters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internazionali_BNL_d%27Italia \"Internazionali BNL d'Italia\")  where he lost to No. 1 Rafael Nadal in a tight match in which he had been up a break in the final set.[[242]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-242)  At the  [French Open](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_French_Open \"2014 French Open\"), Murray defeated  [Andrey Golubev](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrey_Golubev \"Andrey Golubev\")  and Marinko Matosevic before edging out 28th seed Philipp Kohlschreiber 12–10 in the final set. This was the first time Murray had ever gone beyond 7–5 in a deciding set.[[243]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-243)  He followed this up with a straight sets win over Fernando Verdasco and then recorded a five set victory over Frenchman Gaël Monfils in the quarter-final, which saw Murray rise to No. 5 and equal his best ever  [French Open](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open \"French Open\")  by reaching the semi-finals. However, he subsequently lost to Nadal in straight sets, winning only 6 games in the match.[[244]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-244)  After losing the 2014 French Open semi-finals to Nadal, Murray appointed former women's world No. 1, and two-times slam titlist,  [Amélie Mauresmo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amelie_Mauresmo \"Amelie Mauresmo\")  as his coach[[245]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-245)  in a 'historic move' which made Mauresmo the first woman to coach a top male tennis player.[[246]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-AM_appointed-246)\n\nAfter strong grass court seasons in 2012 and 2013, Murray was seeded third for the 2014 Wimbledon Championship, behind Novak Djokovic and Rafael Nadal, who were seeded first and second respectively.[[247]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-247)  He began his title defence with straight sets wins over  [David Goffin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Goffin \"David Goffin\")[[248]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-248)  and  [Blaž Rola](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bla%C5%BE_Rola \"Blaž Rola\"), defeating the latter for the loss of just two games.[[249]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-249)  Murray continued his good form, defeating  [Roberto Bautista Agut](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roberto_Bautista_Agut \"Roberto Bautista Agut\")[[250]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-250)  and Kevin Anderson,[[251]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-251)  the 27th and 20th seeds, again in straight sets to reach his seventh consecutive Wimbledon quarter-final. Murray's defence then came to a halt as Grigor Dimitrov ended his 17 match winning-streak on the grass of Wimbledon (this includes the 2012 Olympics) with a straight sets win, meaning Murray failed to reach the semi-finals for the first time since 2008.[[252]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-252)  After his defeat at the Championships, Murray dropped to No. 10, his lowest ranking since 2008.[[253]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-253)\n\nPrior to the North American hard court swing, Murray announced he was extending his partnership with Amélie Mauresmo until the end of the  [US Open](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Open_(tennis) \"US Open (tennis)\"), but was ideally looking for a long-term deal.[[254]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-254)  He also revealed he had only just returned to a full training schedule following his back surgery last September.[[255]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-255)  Murray reached back-to-back quarter-finals at the  [Canadian Open](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Rogers_Cup \"2014 Rogers Cup\")  and  [Cincinnati Masters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Western_%26_Southern_Open \"2014 Western & Southern Open\"), losing to eventual champions Jo Wilfried Tsonga,[[256]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-256)  after being a break up in the decider,[[257]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-257)  and Roger Federer, after being two breaks up in the second set, respectively.[[258]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-258)  He made it to the quarter-finals of the  [2014 US Open](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_US_Open_(tennis) \"2014 US Open (tennis)\"), losing to  [Novak Djokovic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novak_Djokovic \"Novak Djokovic\"), after earning his first top ten win of the year in the previous round against Jo Wilfried Tsonga.[[259]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-259)  This was the first season since 2009 where Murray failed to reach a grand slam final. As a consequence Murray fell outside of the top 10 ranking places for the first time since June 2008.[[260]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-260)\n\nMurray took a wildcard into the inaugural  [Shenzhen Open](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_ATP_Shenzhen_Open \"2014 ATP Shenzhen Open\")  in China, entering as the number 2 seed. Victories over  [Somdev Devvarman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somdev_Devvarman \"Somdev Devvarman\"),  [Lukáš Lacko](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luk%C3%A1%C5%A1_Lacko \"Lukáš Lacko\")  and Juan Mónaco saw Murray reach his first final of the season, breaking a drought of 14 months following his title at Wimbledon.

He lost the opening rubber against Juan Martín del Potro in five sets.[[325]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-325)  After Great Britain lost the second rubber as well, he teamed up with his brother Jamie to beat del Potro and Leonardo Mayer in the third rubber in four sets.[[326]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-326)  He then won the fourth rubber against  [Guido Pella](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guido_Pella \"Guido Pella\")  in straight sets,[[327]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-327)  though Great Britain eventually lost the tie.[[328]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-328)  Murray then won the  [China Open](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_China_Open_%E2%80%93_Men%27s_Singles \"2016 China Open – Men's Singles\")  for his fifth title of 2016 and 40th career tour title. He defeated  [Andreas Seppi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andreas_Seppi \"Andreas Seppi\"),  [Andrey Kuznetsov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrey_Kuznetsov_(tennis) \"Andrey Kuznetsov (tennis)\"),  [Kyle Edmund](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Edmund \"Kyle Edmund\"),  [David Ferrer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Ferrer \"David Ferrer\"), and  [Grigor Dimitrov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grigor_Dimitrov \"Grigor Dimitrov\")  all in straight sets. Murray then backed this up with a tournament win at the  [Shanghai Rolex Masters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Shanghai_Rolex_Masters_%E2%80%93_Singles \"2016 Shanghai Rolex Masters – Singles\")  defeating  [Steve Johnson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Johnson_(tennis) \"Steve Johnson (tennis)\"),  [Lucas Pouille](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucas_Pouille \"Lucas Pouille\"),  [David Goffin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Goffin \"David Goffin\"),  [Gilles Simon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilles_Simon \"Gilles Simon\"), and  [Roberto Bautista Agut](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roberto_Bautista_Agut \"Roberto Bautista Agut\")  all in straight sets to capture his 13th masters title and 3rd title in Shanghai. This marked his 6th title of 2016 and drew him even with former No. 1 Stefan Edberg at No. 15 on the Open Era titles list with 41 Tour titles each.\n\nMurray brought his win streak to 15 consecutive match wins by winning the Erste Bank Open for his seventh tour title of the 2016 season. His tournament started slowly with three-set wins over  [Martin Klizan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Klizan \"Martin Klizan\")  and Gilles Simon in the first two rounds. However, a decisive win over  [John Isner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Isner \"John Isner\")  in the quarter-final and a walkover due to David Ferrer's withdrawal with a leg injury saw Murray reach the final.[[329]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-329)  There he defeated Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, for his third title in succession.[[330]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-330)  The result saw Murray win seven titles in a single season for the first time in his career, and move to solo 15th on the  [all-time list of singles titles in the Open Era](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis_players_with_most_titles_in_the_Open_Era#Men \"Tennis players with most titles in the Open Era\"), breaking a tie with former world No. 1  [Stefan Edberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stefan_Edberg \"Stefan Edberg\").[[331]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-331)\n\nMurray entered the  [Paris Masters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_BNP_Paribas_Masters \"2016 BNP Paribas Masters\")  knowing that in the event of Djokovic not reaching the final, winning the title would be enough to see him crowned world No. 1 for the first time. After reaching the quarter-finals, courtesy of wins over Fernando Verdasco and  [Lucas Pouille](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucas_Pouille \"Lucas Pouille\"), Murray faced Berdych for a place in the semi-finals, winning in straight sets. Meanwhile, Djokovic lost to  [Marin Cilic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marin_Cilic \"Marin Cilic\"), meaning that Murray would replace Djokovic at the top of the rankings should he reach the final. He was due to face Milos Raonic in the semi-finals. However, Raonic withdrew prior to the start of the match, giving Murray a walkover. As a result, Murray became the first British man to reach No. 1 since the introduction of the rankings in 1973.[[332]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-332)  Murray then defeated John Isner in the final in 3 sets to win his fourth consecutive tournament and first Paris Masters title.[[333]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-333)  In November 2016, Murray reached the  [final of the ATP World Tour Finals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_ATP_World_Tour_Finals_%E2%80%93_Singles \"2016 ATP World Tour Finals – Singles\")  for the first time before winning against Novak Djokovic in two sets, thus reaching  [year-end No. 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ATP_number_1_ranked_singles_tennis_players#Year-end_No._1 \"List of ATP number 1 ranked singles tennis players\")[[334]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-334)  and in doing so, becoming the first player to win a Grand Slam, the ATP World Tour Finals, the men's singles at the Olympic Games and a Masters 1000 title in the same calendar year.

They have met five times at the  [ATP World Tour Finals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATP_World_Tour_Finals \"ATP World Tour Finals\"), with Murray winning in Shanghai in 2008[[435]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-435)  and Federer coming out victorious in London in 2009, 2010, 2012, and in 2014.\n\nIn August 2012, Murray met Federer in the  [final of the London 2012 Olympics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis_at_the_2012_Summer_Olympics_%E2%80%93_Men%27s_singles \"Tennis at the 2012 Summer Olympics – Men's singles\")  at Wimbledon Centre Court, just four weeks after the  [2012 Wimbledon Final](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Wimbledon_Championships_%E2%80%93_Men%27s_Singles_final \"2012 Wimbledon Championships – Men's Singles final\"), in which Federer had defeated Murray to win his record-tying 7th title at the All-England Club. Murray defeated Federer in straight sets to win the gold medal, denying Federer a  [Career Golden Slam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Career_Golden_Slam \"Career Golden Slam\"). In 2013 Murray beat Federer for the first time in a major in the semi-finals of the  [Australian Open](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013_Australian_Open \"2013 Australian Open\"), prevailing in five sets after Federer had come back twice from a set down.[[436]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-436)  Their last grand slam meeting was at the  [2015 Wimbledon Championships](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_Wimbledon_Championships \"2015 Wimbledon Championships\")  semi-finals, where a dominant Federer defeated Murray in straight sets, earning a place in his 10th Wimbledon final. Murray is one of only three players to have recorded 10 or more victories over Federer, the other two being Nadal and Djokovic. Their most recent meeting took place at the  [2015 Cincinnati Masters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_Western_%26_Southern_Open \"2015 Western & Southern Open\")  semi-finals, with Federer winning the match in two close sets, recording his fifth consecutive victory over Murray.[[434]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-h2hFed-434)\n\n### Murray vs. Nadal\n\nMurray has played against  [Rafael Nadal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal \"Rafael Nadal\")  on 24 occasions since  [2007](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_ATP_Tour \"2007 ATP Tour\"), with Nadal leading 17–7. Nadal leads 7–2 on clay, 3–0 on grass and 7–5 on hard courts. The pair regularly meet at  [Grand Slam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis) \"Grand Slam (tennis)\")  level, with nine out of their twenty-four meetings coming in slams, with Nadal leading 7–2 (3–0 at  [Wimbledon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Championships,_Wimbledon \"The Championships, Wimbledon\"), 2–0 at the  [French Open](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open \"French Open\"), 1–1 at the  [Australian Open](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Open \"Australian Open\")  and 1–1 at the  [US Open](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Open_(tennis) \"US Open (tennis)\")).[[437]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-437)  Eight of these nine appearances have been at quarter-final and semi-final level.

The pair had not met for three years since the final of the  [2011 Japan Open](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_Rakuten_Japan_Open_Tennis_Championships \"2011 Rakuten Japan Open Tennis Championships\")  until the quarter-finals of the  [2014 Rome Masters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Internazionali_BNL_d%27Italia \"2014 Internazionali BNL d'Italia\"), although they were scheduled to meet in the semi-final of the  [2012 Miami Masters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Miami_Masters \"2012 Miami Masters\")  before Nadal withdrew with injury.[[441]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-441)  At the semi-final stage of the  [2014 French Open](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_French_Open \"2014 French Open\"), Nadal triumphed in a dominant straight sets win for the loss of just 6 games. In one of their most recent meetings, Murray beat Nadal for the first time on clay, and the first time in a Masters 1000 final, at the  [Madrid Open](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_Mutua_Madrid_Open \"2015 Mutua Madrid Open\")  in 2015.[[442]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-442)  Murray fell to Nadal in the semi-finals of the  [2016 Monte Carlo Masters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Monte-Carlo_Rolex_Masters_%E2%80%93_Singles \"2016 Monte-Carlo Rolex Masters – Singles\"), despite taking the first set.[[443]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-443)  Three weeks later they met again at the semi-final stage of the  [2016 Madrid Open](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Mutua_Madrid_Open_%E2%80%93_Men%27s_Singles \"2016 Mutua Madrid Open – Men's Singles\"), this time Murray winning the match in straight sets.[[444]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-444)\n\n### Murray vs. Wawrinka\n\nMurray and  [Stan Wawrinka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stan_Wawrinka \"Stan Wawrinka\")  have played 20 times with Murray leading 12–8. Murray leads 8–4 on hard courts and 3–0 on grass courts while Wawrinka leads 4–1 on clay courts. They have also met six times in Grand Slam tournaments with each player winning three matches.[[445]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-445)  They have contested some close matches and one of their most notable matches was in the  [2009 Wimbledon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009_Wimbledon_Championships_%E2%80%93_Men%27s_Singles \"2009 Wimbledon Championships – Men's Singles\")  fourth round which Murray won in five sets and was the first men's match to be played under the Wimbledon roof, having the latest finish for a Wimbledon match at the time.[[446]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-446)  Wawrinka also ended Murray's title defense at the  [2013 US Open](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013_US_Open_%E2%80%93_Men%27s_Singles \"2013 US Open – Men's Singles\")  quarter-finals with a comfortable straight sets victory.[[447]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-447)  Other close matches the two have contested include the  [2010 US Open](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_US_Open_%E2%80%93_Men%27s_Singles \"2010 US Open – Men's Singles\")  which Wawrinka won in four sets. Murray won the  [2008 Canada Open](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_Rogers_Masters_%E2%80%93_Singles \"2008 Rogers Masters – Singles\")  and  [2011 Shanghai Masters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_Shanghai_Rolex_Masters_%E2%80%93_Singles \"2011 Shanghai Rolex Masters – Singles\").\n\nWhile Murray has led the majority of the rivalry, Wawrinka won their first two matches and beat Murray three consecutive times between 2013 and 2015, winning all of them in straight sets, until Murray ended the losing streak at the  [2016 French Open](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_French_Open_%E2%80%93_Men%27s_Singles \"2016 French Open – Men's Singles\"), beating the defending champion Wawrinka in four sets to reach his first ever French Open final and become the first British man to do so since 1937. Their most recent match was played in the final of the  [2019 European Open](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_European_Open_%E2%80%93_Singles \"2019 European Open – Singles\"), which Murray won in three sets. Due to this match-up and since both players each have three Grand Slam titles, Wawrinka has been identified by some, including Djokovic, as a potential contender to turn the  [Big Four](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Four_(tennis) \"Big Four (tennis)\")  tennis quartet into a \"Big Five\", although Wawrinka himself has downplayed those suggestions, stating that he is still far behind them.[[448]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-448)[[449]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-449)\n\n## Playing style\n\n[![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/03/Flickr_-_Carine06_-_Andy_Murray_%2810%29.jpg/170px-Flickr_-_Carine06_-_Andy_Murray_%2810%29.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Flickr_-_Carine06_-_Andy_Murray_(10).jpg)\n\nAt the  [Boodles Challenge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boodles_Challenge \"Boodles Challenge\"), Stoke Park, June 2012\n\nMurray plays an  [all-court](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis_strategy#All-court_player \"Tennis strategy\")  game with an emphasis on  [defensive baseline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counterpuncher \"Counterpuncher\")  play, and in 2009 professional tennis coach  [Paul Annacone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Annacone \"Paul Annacone\")  stated that Murray \"may be the best counterpuncher on tour today.\"[[450]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-450)[[451]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-No_surface_tension_as_Murray_looks_to_shed_his_feet_of_clay-451)  His strengths include groundstrokes with low error rate, the ability to anticipate and react, and his transition from defence to offence with speed, which enables him to hit winners from defensive positions. His playing style has been likened to that of  [Miloslav Mečíř](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miloslav_Me%C4%8D%C3%AD%C5%99 \"Miloslav Mečíř\"). Murray also has one of the best two-handed backhands on the tour, with dynamic stroke execution[[452]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-452)  while he primarily uses his forehand, which is more passive, and a sliced backhand to let opponents play into his defensive game before playing more offensively.[[453]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-453)  [Tim Henman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Henman \"Tim Henman\")  stated in 2013 that Murray may have the best  [lob](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lob_(tennis) \"Lob (tennis)\")  in the game, succeeding  [Lleyton Hewitt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lleyton_Hewitt \"Lleyton Hewitt\"). Murray's tactics often involve passive exchanges from the baseline. He is capable of injecting sudden pace into his groundstrokes to surprise his opponents who are used to the slow rally. Murray is also one of the top returners in the game, often able to block back fast serves with his excellent reach and ability to anticipate. For this reason, Murray is rarely aced.[[454]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-454)\n\nMurray is known for being one of the most intelligent tacticians on the court, often constructing points.[[455]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-455)[[456]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-456)  Other strengths in his game, although not huge parts of his game, include his  [drop shot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drop_shot \"Drop shot\")[[457]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-457)  and net game.[[458]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-458)  As he plays predominantly from the baseline, he usually approaches the net to  [volley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volley_(tennis) \"Volley (tennis)\")  when finishing points more quickly.[[459]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-459)  Murray is most proficient on a fast surface, like grass, where he has won eight singles titles including the  [Wimbledon Championships](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Championships,_Wimbledon \"The Championships, Wimbledon\")  and the  [2012 Olympic Gold Medal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis_at_the_2012_Summer_Olympics \"Tennis at the 2012 Summer Olympics\"), although hard courts are his preferred surface.[[451]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-No_surface_tension_as_Murray_looks_to_shed_his_feet_of_clay-451)  He has worked hard since 2008 on improving his clay court game,[[460]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-460)  ultimately winning his first clay titles during 2015 at  [Munich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_BMW_Open_%E2%80%93_Singles \"2015 BMW Open – Singles\")  and  [Madrid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_Mutua_Madrid_Open_%E2%80%93_Men%27s_Singles \"2015 Mutua Madrid Open – Men's Singles\"), as well as reaching his first French Open final during 2016. While Murray's  [serve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serve_(tennis) \"Serve (tennis)\")  is a major weapon for him, with his first serve reaching speeds of 130 mph or higher on some occasions and winning him many free points,[[461]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-How_Andy_Murray_turned_a_second_serve_into_a_lethal_weapon-461)  it can become inconsistent when hit under pressure,[[462]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-462)  especially with a more vulnerable and slower second serve. Since the 2011 season, under Ivan Lendl's coaching, Murray has played a more offensive game and has also worked to improve his second serve, forehand, consistency and mental game which have all been crucial to his further success.[[461]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-How_Andy_Murray_turned_a_second_serve_into_a_lethal_weapon-461)[[463]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-463)[[464]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-464)[[465]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-465)\n\n## Endorsements and equipment\n\nIn 2009, German manufacturer  [Adidas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adidas \"Adidas\")  and Murray signed a five-year-deal worth £30 million. This included wearing their range of tennis shoes.[[466]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-466)  The contract with Adidas allowed Murray to keep his shirt sleeve sponsors  [Shiatzy Chen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiatzy_Chen \"Shiatzy Chen\"),  [Royal Bank of Scotland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Royal_Bank_of_Scotland \"The Royal Bank of Scotland\")  and  [Highland Spring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Highland_Spring \"Highland Spring\"). Before he was signed by Adidas in late 2009, he wore Fred Perry apparel.[[467]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-467)  At the end of their contract together Adidas decided not to re-sign with Murray,[[468]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-468)  and he began a 4-year partnership with athletic apparel company  [Under Armour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Under_Armour \"Under Armour\")  in December 2014,[[469]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-469)  reportedly worth $25 million.[[470]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-470)  Murray signed with Castore for the 2019 season which Murray called his last deal before announcing his retirement.[[471]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-471)[[472]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-472)\n\nMurray uses  [Head](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_(company) \"Head (company)\")  rackets, and regularly appears in advertisements for the brand.[[473]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-473)  He endorses the Head Radical Pro model, whereas his actual playing racket (underneath the various Radical Pro paintjobs) is reported to be a customized pro stock PT57A, derived from the original Pro Tour 630 model, but with a 16×19 string pattern.[[474]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-474)[[475]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-475)  The racquet used to be set up extremely heavy at the beginning of his career, but after a 2007 wrist injury its weight was lowered.[[476]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-476)\n\nIn June 2012, the Swiss watch manufacturer  [Rado](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rado_(watch) \"Rado (watch)\")  announced that Murray had signed a deal to wear their D-Star 200 model.[[477]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-477)\n\n## Coaches\n\nMurray's coaching staff has changed through the years and are as follows:  [Leon Smith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leon_Smith_(tennis) \"Leon Smith (tennis)\")  (1998–2004), Pato Álvarez (2003–2005),  [Mark Petchey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Petchey \"Mark Petchey\")  (2005–2006),  [Brad Gilbert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Gilbert \"Brad Gilbert\")  (2006–2007),  [Miles Maclagan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miles_Maclagan \"Miles Maclagan\")  (2007–2010),  [Àlex Corretja](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%80lex_Corretja \"Àlex Corretja\")  (2010–2011),  [Ivan Lendl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivan_Lendl \"Ivan Lendl\")  (2011–2014, 2016–2017),  [Amélie Mauresmo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Am%C3%A9lie_Mauresmo \"Amélie Mauresmo\")  (2014–2016),  [Jonas Björkman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonas_Bj%C3%B6rkman \"Jonas Björkman\")  (2015),[[478]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-478)  [Jamie Delgado](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamie_Delgado \"Jamie Delgado\")  (2016–).[[479]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-479)\n\n## Charitable work\n\nMurray is a founding member of the  [Malaria No More UK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaria_No_More_UK \"Malaria No More UK\")  Leadership Council and helped launch the charity in 2009 with  [David Beckham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Beckham \"David Beckham\").

The event named  [Rally Against Cancer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013_Aegon_Championships#Rally_Against_Cancer \"2013 Aegon Championships\")  was organised to raise money for Royal Marsden Cancer Charity after his best friend and fellow British player Ross Hutchins was diagnosed with  [Hodgkin's lymphoma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hodgkin%27s_lymphoma \"Hodgkin's lymphoma\").[[483]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-483)[[484]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-484)  The event took place following the final day of competitive play at the  [AEGON Championships](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013_Aegon_Championships \"2013 Aegon Championships\"), on Sunday 16 June. Subsequently, following his victory at the tournament, Murray donated his entire prize money pot to  [The Royal Marsden Cancer Charity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Royal_Marsden_NHS_Foundation_Trust \"The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust\").[[485]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-485)\n\nIn June 2014, following the death of  [Elena Baltacha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elena_Baltacha \"Elena Baltacha\")  due to  [liver cancer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_cancer \"Liver cancer\"), Murray featured in an event known as 'Rally for Bally'. Murray played at Queen's Club alongside Victoria Azarenka,  [Martina Hingis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martina_Hingis \"Martina Hingis\"), Heather Watson and his brother Jamie.

He gained worldwide fame for his double sprint victory in world record times at the  [2008 Beijing Olympics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_Summer_Olympics \"2008 Summer Olympics\"), which made him the first person to hold both records since  [fully automatic time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fully_automatic_time \"Fully automatic time\")  became mandatory.\n\nAn eleven-time  [World Champion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Championships_in_Athletics \"World Championships in Athletics\"), he won consecutive  [World Championship 100 m](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres_at_the_World_Championships_in_Athletics \"100 metres at the World Championships in Athletics\"),  [200 m](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/200_metres_at_the_World_Championships_in_Athletics \"200 metres at the World Championships in Athletics\")  and  [4 × 100 metres relay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4_%C3%97_100_metres_relay_at_the_World_Championships_in_Athletics \"4 × 100 metres relay at the World Championships in Athletics\")  gold medals from 2009 to 2015, with the exception of a 100 m  [false start](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_start \"False start\")  in 2011. He is the  [most successful athlete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IAAF_World_Championships_in_Athletics#Multiple_medallist \"IAAF World Championships in Athletics\")  of the World Championships. Bolt is the first athlete to win four World Championship titles in the 200 m and is the joint-most successful in the 100 m with three titles.\n\nBolt improved upon his second  [100 m world record](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Men%27s_100_metres_world_record_progression \"Men's 100 metres world record progression\")  of 9.69 with 9.58 seconds in 2009 – the biggest improvement since the start of electronic timing. He has twice broken the  [200 metres world record](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Men%27s_200_metres_world_record_progression \"Men's 200 metres world record progression\"), setting 19.30 in 2008 and 19.19 in 2009. He has helped Jamaica to three  [4 × 100 metres relay world records](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Men%27s_4_%C3%97_100_metres_relay_world_record_progression \"Men's 4 × 100 metres relay world record progression\"), with the current record being 36.84 seconds set in 2012. Bolt's most successful event is the 200 m, with three Olympic and four World titles. The 2008 Olympics was his international debut over 100 m; he had earlier won numerous 200 m medals (including  [2007 World Championship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_World_Championships_in_Athletics \"2007 World Championships in Athletics\")  silver) and holds the  [world under-20](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_world_junior_records_in_athletics \"List of world junior records in athletics\")  and  [world under-18 records](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_world_youth_bests_in_athletics \"List of world youth bests in athletics\")  for the event.\n\nHis achievements as a sprinter have earned him the media nickname \"Lightning Bolt\", and his awards include the  [IAAF World Athlete of the Year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IAAF_World_Athlete_of_the_Year \"IAAF World Athlete of the Year\"),  [Track & Field Athlete of the Year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_%26_Field_Athlete_of_the_Year \"Track & Field Athlete of the Year\"),  [BBC Overseas Sports Personality of the Year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Overseas_Sports_Personality_of_the_Year \"BBC Overseas Sports Personality of the Year\")  (three times) and  [Laureus World Sportsman of the Year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laureus_World_Sports_Award_for_Sportsman_of_the_Year \"Laureus World Sports Award for Sportsman of the Year\")  (four times). Bolt retired after the  [2017 World Championships](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_World_Championships_in_Athletics \"2017 World Championships in Athletics\"), when he finished third in his last solo 100 m race, opted out of the 200 m, and pulled up in the 4×100 m relay final.\n\nStating that it was his \"dream\" to play professional  [association football](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football \"Association football\"), in August 2018 Bolt began training with Australian  [A-League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A-League \"A-League\")  club the  [Central Coast Mariners](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Coast_Mariners_FC \"Central Coast Mariners FC\")  as a  [left-winger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winger_(association_football) \"Winger (association football)\"). On 12 October 2018, Bolt scored twice for the team in a friendly match. He left the club the following month, and in January 2019 chose not to pursue a career in football.[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usain_Bolt#cite_note-19)\n\n## Early years\n\nBolt was born on 21 August 1986 to parents Wellesley and Jennifer Bolt[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usain_Bolt#cite_note-IAAFProfile-12)  in  [Sherwood Content](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherwood_Content \"Sherwood Content\"),[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usain_Bolt#cite_note-guardian1-20)  a small town in Jamaica. He has a brother, Sadiki,[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usain_Bolt#cite_note-21)  and a sister, Sherine.[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usain_Bolt#cite_note-Helps-22)[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usain_Bolt#cite_note-si-23)  His parents ran the local grocery store in the rural area, and Bolt spent his time playing  [cricket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_(sport) \"Cricket (sport)\")  and  [football](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football \"Association football\")  in the street with his brother,[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usain_Bolt#cite_note-24)  later saying, \"When I was young, I didn't really think about anything other than sports.\"[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usain_Bolt#cite_note-BrillBolt-25)  As a child, Bolt attended Waldensia Primary, where he began showing his sprint potential when he ran in his parish's annual national primary school meet.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usain_Bolt#cite_note-Focus-1)  By the age of twelve, Bolt had become the school's fastest runner over the  [100 metres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres \"100 metres\")  distance.[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usain_Bolt#cite_note-26)\n\nUpon his entry to  [William Knibb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Knibb \"William Knibb\")  Memorial High School, Bolt continued to focus on other sports, but his cricket coach noticed Bolt's speed on the pitch and urged him to try track and field events.[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usain_Bolt#cite_note-BBC10-27)  [Pablo McNeil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pablo_McNeil \"Pablo McNeil\"), a former Olympic sprint athlete,[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usain_Bolt#cite_note-McNeil-28)  and Dwayne Jarrett coached Bolt,[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usain_Bolt#cite_note-Jarrett-29)  encouraging him to focus his energy on improving his athletic abilities. The school had a history of success in athletics with past students, including sprinter  [Michael Green](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Green_(sprinter) \"Michael Green (sprinter)\").[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usain_Bolt#cite_note-Focus-1)  Bolt won his first annual  [high school championships](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter-Secondary_Schools_Boys_and_Girls_Championships \"Inter-Secondary Schools Boys and Girls Championships\")  medal in 2001; he took the silver medal in the  [200 metres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/200_m \"200 m\")  with a time of 22.04 seconds.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usain_Bolt#cite_note-Focus-1)  McNeil soon became his primary coach, and the two enjoyed a positive partnership, although McNeil was occasionally frustrated by Bolt's lack of dedication to his training and his penchant for practical jokes.[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usain_Bolt#cite_note-McNeil-28)\n\nWhen Bolt was a boy, he attended Sherwood Content  [Seventh-day Adventist Church](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seventh-day_Adventist_Church \"Seventh-day Adventist Church\")  in  [Trelawny](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trelawny_Parish \"Trelawny Parish\"), Jamaica, with his  [mother](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mother \"Mother\"). His mother didn't serve  [pork](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pork \"Pork\")  to him in accordance with Adventist beliefs.[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usain_Bolt#cite_note-30)\n\n### Early competitions\n\nPerforming for Jamaica in his first Caribbean regional event, Bolt clocked a personal best time of 48.28 s in the  [400 metres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/400_metres \"400 metres\")  in the 2001  [CARIFTA Games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CARIFTA_Games \"CARIFTA Games\"), winning a silver medal. The 200 m also yielded a silver, as Bolt finished in 21.81 s.[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usain_Bolt#cite_note-Carifta-31)\n\nHe made his first appearance on the world stage at the  [2001 IAAF World Youth Championships](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001_World_Youth_Championships_in_Athletics \"2001 World Youth Championships in Athletics\")  in  [Debrecen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debrecen \"Debrecen\"), Hungary. Running in the 200 m event, he failed to qualify for the finals, but he still set a new personal best of 21.73 s.[[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usain_Bolt#cite_note-32)  Bolt still did not take athletics or himself too seriously, however, and he took his mischievousness to new heights by hiding in the back of a van when he was supposed to be preparing for the 200 m finals at the CARIFTA Trials. He was detained by the police for his practical joke, and there was an outcry from the local community, which blamed coach McNeil for the incident.[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usain_Bolt#cite_note-McNeil-28)  However, the controversy subsided, and both McNeil and Bolt went to the CARIFTA Games, where Bolt set championship records in the 200 m and 400 m with times of 21.12 s and 47.33 s, respectively.[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usain_Bolt#cite_note-Carifta-31)  He continued to set records with 20.61 s and 47.12 s finishes at the  [Central American and Caribbean Junior Championships](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_American_and_Caribbean_Junior_Championships \"Central American and Caribbean Junior Championships\").[[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usain_Bolt#cite_note-33)\n\nBolt is one of only nine athletes (along with  [Valerie Adams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valerie_Adams \"Valerie Adams\"),  [Veronica Campbell-Brown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veronica_Campbell-Brown \"Veronica Campbell-Brown\"),  [Jacques Freitag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_Freitag \"Jacques Freitag\"),  [Yelena Isinbayeva](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yelena_Isinbayeva \"Yelena Isinbayeva\"),  [Jana Pittman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jana_Pittman \"Jana Pittman\"),  [Dani Samuels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dani_Samuels \"Dani Samuels\"),  [David Storl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Storl \"David Storl\"), and  [Kirani James](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirani_James \"Kirani James\")) to win world championships at the youth, junior, and senior level of an athletic event. Former Prime Minister  [P. J. Patterson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P._J._Patterson \"P. J. Patterson\")  recognised Bolt's talent and arranged for him to move to  [Kingston](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingston,_Jamaica \"Kingston, Jamaica\"), along with  [Jermaine Gonzales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jermaine_Gonzales \"Jermaine Gonzales\"), so he could train with the  [Jamaica Amateur Athletic Association](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaica_Amateur_Athletic_Association \"Jamaica Amateur Athletic Association\")  (JAAA) at the  [University of Technology, Jamaica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Technology,_Jamaica \"University of Technology, Jamaica\").[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usain_Bolt#cite_note-McNeil-28)\n\n### Rise to prominence\n\nThe  [2002 World Junior Championships](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2002_World_Junior_Championships_in_Athletics \"2002 World Junior Championships in Athletics\")  were held in front of a home crowd in Kingston, Jamaica, and Bolt was given a chance to prove his credentials on a world stage. By the age of 15, he had grown to 1.96 metres (6 ft 5 in) tall, and he physically stood out among his peers.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usain_Bolt#cite_note-Focus-1)  He won the 200 m in a time of 20.61 s,[[32]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usain_Bolt#cite_note-34)  which was 0.03 s slower than his personal best of 20.58 s, which he set in the 1st round.[[33]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usain_Bolt#cite_note-35)  Bolt's 200 m win made him the youngest world-junior gold medallist ever.[[34]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usain_Bolt#cite_note-Longmore-36)  The expectation from the home crowd had made him so nervous that he had put his shoes on the wrong feet, although he realized the mistake before the race began[[35]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usain_Bolt#cite_note-37). However, it turned out to be a revelatory experience for Bolt, as he vowed never again to let himself be affected by pre-race nerves.[[36]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usain_Bolt#cite_note-38)  As a member of the Jamaican  [sprint relay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_relay \"Sprint relay\")  team, he also took two silver medals and set national junior records in the  [4×100 metres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4_%C3%97_100_metres_relay \"4 × 100 metres relay\")  and  [4×400 metres relay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4_%C3%97_400_metres_relay \"4 × 400 metres relay\"), running times of 39.15 s and 3:04.06 minutes respectively.[[37]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usain_Bolt#cite_note-39)[[38]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usain_Bolt#cite_note-40)\n\nThe rush of medals continued as he won four golds at the  [2003 CARIFTA Games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2003_CARIFTA_Games \"2003 CARIFTA Games\")  and was awarded the  [Austin Sealy Trophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CARIFTA_Games#Austin_Sealy_Award_Winners \"CARIFTA Games\")  for the most outstanding athlete of the games.[[39]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usain_Bolt#cite_note-carifta1-41)[[40]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usain_Bolt#cite_note-carifta2-42)[[41]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usain_Bolt#cite_note-43)  He won another gold at the  [2003 World Youth Championships](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2003_World_Youth_Championships_in_Athletics \"2003 World Youth Championships in Athletics\"). He set a new championship record in the 200 m with a time of 20.40 s, despite a 1.1  [m/s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre_per_second \"Metre per second\")  [head wind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_m#Climatic_conditions \"100 m\").[[42]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usain_Bolt#cite_note-44)  [Michael Johnson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Johnson_(athlete) \"Michael Johnson (athlete)\"), the 200 m world-record holder, took note of Bolt's potential but worried that the young sprinter might be over-pressured, stating, \"It's all about what he does three, four, five years down the line\".[[43]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usain_Bolt#cite_note-Thunder-45)  Bolt had also impressed the athletics hierarchy, and he received the  [IAAF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IAAF \"IAAF\")  Rising Star Award for 2002.[[44]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usain_Bolt#cite_note-Beyond-46)\n\nBolt competed in his final Jamaican High School Championships in 2003. He broke the 200 m and 400 m records with times of 20.25 s and 45.35 s, respectively. Bolt's runs were a significant improvement upon the previous records, beating the 200 m best by more than half a second and the 400 m record by almost a second.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usain_Bolt#cite_note-Focus-1)  While Bolt improved upon the 200 m time three months later, setting the still-standing  [World youth best](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_world_youth_bests_in_athletics \"List of world youth bests in athletics\")  at the  [2003 Pan American Junior Championships](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2003_Pan_American_Junior_Championships \"2003 Pan American Junior Championships\").[[45]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usain_Bolt#cite_note-47)  The 400 m time remains No. 6 on the all-time youth list, surpassed only once since, by future Olympic champion  [Kirani James](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirani_James \"Kirani James\").[[46]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usain_Bolt#cite_note-48)\n\nBolt turned his main focus to the 200 m and equalled  [Roy Martin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roy_Martin_(sprinter) \"Roy Martin (sprinter)\")'s  [world junior record](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_world_junior_records_in_athletics \"List of world junior records in athletics\")  of 20.13 s at the Pan-American Junior Championships.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usain_Bolt#cite_note-Focus-1)[[47]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usain_Bolt#cite_note-49)  This performance attracted interest from the press, and his times in the 200 m and 400 m led to him being touted as a possible successor to Johnson. Indeed, at sixteen years old, Bolt had reached times that Johnson did not register until he was twenty, and Bolt's 200 m time was superior to  [Maurice Greene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maurice_Greene_(athlete) \"Maurice Greene (athlete)\")'s season's best that year.[[43]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usain_Bolt#cite_note-Thunder-45)\n\nBolt was growing more popular in his homeland. Howard Hamilton, who was given the task of Public Defender by the government, urged the JAAA to nurture him and prevent  [burnout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burnout_(psychology) \"Burnout (psychology)\"), calling Bolt \"the most phenomenal sprinter ever produced by this island\".[[43]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usain_Bolt#cite_note-Thunder-45)  His popularity and the attractions of the capital city were beginning to be a burden to the young sprinter. Bolt was increasingly unfocused on his athletic career and preferred to eat fast food, play basketball, and party in Kingston's club scene. In the absence of a disciplined lifestyle, he became ever-more reliant on his natural ability to beat his competitors on the track.[[48]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usain_Bolt#cite_note-50)\n\nAs the reigning 200 m champion at both the World Youth and World Junior championships, Bolt hoped to take a clean sweep of the world 200 m championships in the  [Senior World Championships](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2003_World_Championships_in_Athletics \"2003 World Championships in Athletics\")  in Paris.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usain_Bolt#cite_note-Focus-1)  He beat all comers at the 200 m in the World Championship trials. Bolt was pragmatic about his chances and noted that, even if he did not make the final, he would consider setting a personal best a success.[[43]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usain_Bolt#cite_note-Thunder-45)[[49]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usain_Bolt#cite_note-WC03-51)  However, he suffered a bout of  [conjunctivitis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjunctivitis \"Conjunctivitis\")  before the event, and it ruined his training schedule.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usain_Bolt#cite_note-Focus-1)  Realising that he would not be in peak condition, the JAAA refused to let him participate in the finals, on the grounds that he was too young and inexperienced. Bolt was dismayed at missing out on the opportunity, but focused on getting himself in shape to gain a place on the Jamaican Olympic team instead.[[49]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usain_Bolt#cite_note-WC03-51)  Even though he missed the World Championships, Bolt was awarded the IAAF Rising Star Award for the 2003 season on the strength of his junior record-equalling run.[[44]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usain_Bolt#cite_note-Beyond-46)[[50]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usain_Bolt#cite_note-52)\n## Personal life\n\n[![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5e/Usain_Bolt_2011_World_Athletics_Gala.jpg/220px-Usain_Bolt_2011_World_Athletics_Gala.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Usain_Bolt_2011_World_Athletics_Gala.jpg)\n\nBolt with the IAAF men's  [Athlete of the Year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IAAF_World_Athlete_of_the_Year \"IAAF World Athlete of the Year\")  award in  [Monaco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monaco \"Monaco\")\n\nBolt expresses a love for dancing and his character is frequently described as laid-back and relaxed.[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usain_Bolt#cite_note-BBC10-27)[[256]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usain_Bolt#cite_note-258)  His Jamaican track and field idols include  [Herb McKenley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herb_McKenley \"Herb McKenley\")  and former Jamaican 100 m and 200 m world record holder,  [Don Quarrie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Quarrie \"Don Quarrie\").  [Michael Johnson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Johnson_(sprinter) \"Michael Johnson (sprinter)\"), the former 200 m world and Olympic record holder, is also held in high esteem by Bolt.[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usain_Bolt#cite_note-BBC10-27)\n\nBolt has the nickname \"Lightning Bolt\" due to his name and speed.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usain_Bolt#cite_note-Focus-1)  He is  [Catholic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholicism \"Catholicism\")  and known for making the  [sign of the cross](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sign_of_the_cross \"Sign of the cross\")  before racing competitively, and he wears a  [Miraculous Medal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miraculous_Medal \"Miraculous Medal\")  during his races. His middle name is St. Leo.[[257]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usain_Bolt#cite_note-catholicnewsagency1-259)\n\nIn 2010, Bolt also revealed his fondness of music, when he played a  [reggae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reggae \"Reggae\")  DJ set to a crowd in Paris.[[258]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usain_Bolt#cite_note-260)  He is also an avid fan of the  _[Call of Duty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_of_Duty \"Call of Duty\")_  video game series, saying, \"I stay up late [playing the game online], I can't help it.\"[[259]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usain_Bolt#cite_note-261)\n\nIn his autobiography, Bolt reveals that he has suffered from  [scoliosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scoliosis \"Scoliosis\"), a condition that has curved his spine to the right and has made his right leg half an inch shorter than his left.[[260]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usain_Bolt#cite_note-262)  A result of this is that his left leg remains on the ground 14 percent longer than his right leg, with left leg striking with 955 lbs of force and right with 1080 lbs. Biomechanics researchers have studied, with no firm conclusions, whether this asymmetry has helped or hurt Bolt in his sprinting career.[[261]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usain_Bolt#cite_note-263)\n\nHe popularised the \"lightning bolt\" pose, also known as \"to di world\" or \"bolting\", which he used both before races and in celebration.

His career spanned from 1979 to 1996, when he last won an Olympic event. He is one of only three Olympic athletes who won a gold medal in the same individual event in four consecutive Olympic Games.\n\nLewis was a dominant sprinter and long jumper who topped the world rankings in the  [100 m](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_meters \"100 meters\"),  [200 m](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/200_meters \"200 meters\")  and  [long jump](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_jump \"Long jump\")  events frequently from 1981 to the early 1990s. He set  [world records](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_world_records_in_athletics \"List of world records in athletics\")  in the 100 m,  [4 × 100 m](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4_%C3%97_100_meters_relay \"4 × 100 meters relay\")  and  [4 × 200 m relays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4_%C3%97_200_meters_relay \"4 × 200 meters relay\"), while his  [world record](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_records_in_athletics#Indoor_world_records \"World records in athletics\")  in the indoor long jump has stood since 1984. His 65 consecutive victories in the long jump achieved over a span of 10 years is one of the sport's longest undefeated streaks. Over the course of his athletics career, Lewis broke ten seconds for the 100 meters 15 times and 20 seconds for the 200 meters 10 times. Lewis also long jumped over 28 feet 71 times.\n\nHis accomplishments have led to numerous accolades, including being voted \"World Athlete of the Century\" by the  [International Association of Athletics Federations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Association_of_Athletics_Federations \"International Association of Athletics Federations\")  and \"Sportsman of the Century\" by the  [International Olympic Committee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Olympic_Committee \"International Olympic Committee\"), \"Olympian of the Century\" by  _[Sports Illustrated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_Illustrated \"Sports Illustrated\")_  and \"Athlete of the Year\" by  _[Track & Field News](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_%26_Field_News \"Track & Field News\")_  in 1982, 1983, and 1984.\n\nAfter retiring from his athletics career, Lewis became an actor and has appeared in a number of films. In 2011, he attempted to run for a seat as a  [Democrat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States) \"Democratic Party (United States)\")  in the  [New Jersey Senate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey_Senate \"New Jersey Senate\"), but was removed from the ballot due to the state's residency requirement.

His mother was a hurdler on the 1951 Pan-Am team.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Lewis#cite_note-TFNInterview-3)  His older brother  [Cleveland Lewis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Lewis \"Cleveland Lewis\")  played professional soccer for the  [Memphis Rogues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memphis_Rogues \"Memphis Rogues\").[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Lewis#cite_note-4)  His parents ran a local athletics club that provided a crucial influence on both Carl and his sister  [Carol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carol_Lewis \"Carol Lewis\").[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Lewis#cite_note-dadobit-5)  She became an elite long jumper, finishing 9th at the 1984 Olympics and taking bronze at the 1983 World Championships.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Lewis#cite_note-6)\n\nLewis was initially coached by his father, who also coached other local athletes to elite status.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Lewis#cite_note-dadobit-5)  At age 13, Lewis began competing in the long jump, and he emerged as a promising athlete while coached by Andy Dudek and Paul Minore at  [Willingboro High School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willingboro_High_School \"Willingboro High School\")  in his hometown of  [Willingboro Township, New Jersey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willingboro_Township,_New_Jersey \"Willingboro Township, New Jersey\").[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Lewis#cite_note-TFNInterview-3)[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Lewis#cite_note-7)  He achieved the ranking of fourth on the all-time World Junior list of long jumpers.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Lewis#cite_note-TFNInterview-3)\n\nMany colleges tried to recruit Lewis, and he chose to enroll at the  [University of Houston](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Houston \"University of Houston\")  where Tom Tellez was coach. Tellez would thereafter remain Lewis's coach for his entire career. Days after graduating from high school in 1979, Lewis broke the high school long jump record with a leap of 8.13 m (26 ft 8 in).[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Lewis#cite_note-8)  By the end of 1979, Lewis was ranked fifth in the world for the long jump, according to  _Track and Field News_.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Lewis#cite_note-ljworldrank-9)\n\nAn old knee injury had flared up again at the end of the high school year, and this might have had consequences on his fitness. Lewis worked with Tellez and adapted his technique so that he was able to jump without pain, and he went on to win the 1980  [National Collegiate Athletic Association](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Collegiate_Athletic_Association \"National Collegiate Athletic Association\")  (NCAA) title with a wind-assisted jump of 8.35 m (27 ft  4  1⁄2 in).[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Lewis#cite_note-TFNInterview-3)\n\nThough his focus was on the long jump, he was now starting to emerge as a talent in the sprints. Comparisons were beginning to be made with  [Jesse Owens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesse_Owens \"Jesse Owens\"), who dominated sprint and long jump events in the 1930s. Lewis qualified for the American team for the  [1980 Olympics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1980_Summer_Olympics \"1980 Summer Olympics\")  in the long jump and as a member of the 4 × 100 m relay team.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Lewis#cite_note-TFNInterview-3)  The  [Olympic boycott](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1980_Summer_Olympics_boycott \"1980 Summer Olympics boycott\")  precluded Lewis from competing in Moscow; he instead participated in the  [Liberty Bell Classic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberty_Bell_Classic \"Liberty Bell Classic\")  in July 1980, which was an alternate meet for boycotting nations. He jumped 7.77 m (25 ft  5  3⁄4 in) for a bronze medal, and the American 4 × 100 m relay team won gold with a time of 38.61 s.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Lewis#cite_note-10)  Lewis received one of 461  [Congressional Gold Medals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Congressional_Gold_Medal_recipients \"List of Congressional Gold Medal recipients\")  created especially for the athletes precluded from competing in the 1980 Olympics.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Lewis#cite_note-11)  At year's end, Lewis was ranked 6th in the world in the long jump and 7th in the 100 m.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Lewis#cite_note-ljworldrank-9)[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Lewis#cite_note-100worldrank-12)\n\n### Breakthrough in 1981 and 1982\n\nAt the start of 1981, Lewis's best legal long jump was his high school record from 1979. On June 20, Lewis improved his personal best by almost half a meter by leaping 8.62 m (28 ft  3  1⁄4 in) at the  [TAC Championships](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Outdoor_Track_and_Field_Championships \"USA Outdoor Track and Field Championships\")  while still a teenager.[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Lewis#cite_note-13)\n\nWhile marks set at the thinner air of high altitude are eligible for world records,[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Lewis#cite_note-altitude-14)  Lewis was determined to set his records at sea level. In response to a question about his skipping a 1982 long jump competition at altitude, he said, \"I want the record and I plan to get it, but not at altitude. I don't want that '(A)' [for altitude] after the mark.\"[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Lewis#cite_note-15)  When he gained prominence in the early 1980s, all the extant men's 100 m and 200 m records and the long jump record had been set at the  [high altitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1968_in_athletics#Altitude \"1968 in athletics\")  of  [Mexico City](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico_City \"Mexico City\").[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Lewis#cite_note-altitude-14)\n\nAlso in 1981, Lewis became the fastest 100 m sprinter in the world. His relatively modest best from 1979 (10.67 s) improved to a world-class 10.21 the next year. But 1981 saw him run 10.00 s at the Southwest Conference Championships in Dallas on May 16, a time that was the third-fastest in history and stood as the low-altitude record.[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Lewis#cite_note-16)  For the first time, Lewis was ranked number one in the world, in both the 100 m and the long jump. He won his first national titles in the 100 m and long jump. Additionally, he won the  [James E. Sullivan Award](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_E._Sullivan_Award \"James E. Sullivan Award\")  as the top amateur athlete in the United States.[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Lewis#cite_note-17)\n\nIn 1982, Lewis continued his dominance, and for the first time it seemed someone might challenge  [Bob Beamon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Beamon \"Bob Beamon\")'s world record of 8.90 m (29 ft  2  1⁄4 in) in the long jump set at the  [1968 Olympics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1968_Summer_Olympics \"1968 Summer Olympics\"), a mark often described as one of the greatest athletic achievements ever.[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Lewis#cite_note-18)  Before Lewis, 28 ft 0 in (8.53 m) had been exceeded on two occasions by two people: Beamon and  [1980 Olympic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1980_Summer_Olympics \"1980 Summer Olympics\")  champion  [Lutz Dombrowski](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lutz_Dombrowski \"Lutz Dombrowski\"). During 1982, Lewis cleared 28 ft 0 in (8.53 m) five times outdoors, twice more indoors, going as far as 8.7 m (28 ft  6  1⁄2 in) at Indianapolis on July 24.[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Lewis#cite_note-19)  He also ran 10.00 s in the 100 m, the world's fastest time, matching his low-altitude record from 1981. He achieved his 10.00 s clocking the same weekend he leapt 8.61 m (28 ft  2  3⁄4 in) twice, and the day he recorded his new low-altitude record 8.76 m (28 ft  8  3⁄4 in) at  [Indianapolis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis \"Indianapolis\"), he had three fouls with his toe barely over the board, two of which seemed to exceed Beamon's record, the third which several observers said reached 30 ft 0 in (9.14 m). Lewis said he should have been credited with that jump, claiming the track officials misinterpreted the rules on fouls.[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Lewis#cite_note-20)\n\nHe repeated his number one ranking in the 100 m and long jump, and ranked number six in the 200 m. Additionally, he was named Athlete of the Year by  _Track and Field News_. From 1981 until 1992, Lewis topped the 100 m ranking six times (seven if  [Ben Johnson's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Johnson_(Canadian_sprinter) \"Ben Johnson (Canadian sprinter)\")  1987 top ranking is ignored), and ranked no lower than third.[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Lewis#cite_note-100worldrank-12)  His dominance in the long jump was even greater, as he topped the rankings nine times during the same period, and ranked second in the other years.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Lewis#cite_note-ljworldrank-9)\n\n### 1983 and the inaugural World Championships\n\nThe  [International Association of Athletics Federations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Association_of_Athletics_Federations \"International Association of Athletics Federations\")  (IAAF), the governing body of track and field, organized the first  [World Championships](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IAAF_World_Championships_in_Athletics \"IAAF World Championships in Athletics\")  in 1983. Lewis's chief rival in the long jump was predicted to be the man who last beat him: Larry Myricks. But though Myricks had joined Lewis in surpassing 28 ft 0 in (8.53 m) the year before, he failed to qualify for the American team, and Lewis won at Helsinki with relative ease. His winning leap of 8.55 m (28 ft  1⁄2 in) defeated silver medalist Jason Grimes by 0.26 m (10 in).[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Lewis#cite_note-21)\n\nHe also won the 100 m with relative ease. There,  [Calvin Smith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calvin_Smith \"Calvin Smith\")  who had earlier that year set a new world record in the 100 m at altitude with a 9.93 s performance, was soundly beaten by Lewis 10.07 s to 10.21 s.[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Lewis#cite_note-22)  Smith won the 200 m title,[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Lewis#cite_note-23)  an event which Lewis had not entered, but even there he was partly in Lewis's shadow as Lewis had set an American record in that event earlier that year. He won the 200 m on June 19 at the TAC/Mobil Championships in 19.75 s, the second-fastest time in history and the low-altitude record, only 0.03 s behind  [Pietro Mennea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pietro_Mennea \"Pietro Mennea\")'s 1979 mark. Observers here noted that Lewis probably could have broken the world record if he did not ease off in the final meters to raise his arms in celebration.[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Lewis#cite_note-Field_News'_1983,_p.4,_9-24)[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Lewis#cite_note-25)  Finally, Lewis ran the  [anchor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anchor_leg \"Anchor leg\")  in the 4 × 100 m relay, winning in 37.86 s, a new world record and the first in Lewis's career.[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Lewis#cite_note-26)\n\nLewis's year-best performances in the 100 m and long jump were not at the World Championships, but at other meets. He became the first person to run a sub-10 second 100 m at low-altitude with a 9.97 s in  [Modesto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modesto,_California \"Modesto, California\")  on May 14.[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Lewis#cite_note-27)[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Lewis#cite_note-28)  His gold at the World Championships and his other fast times earned him the number one ranking in the world that year, despite Calvin Smith's world record. At the TAC Championships on June 19, he set a new low-altitude record in the long jump, 8.79 m (28 ft 10 in)[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Lewis#cite_note-Field_News'_1983,_p.4,_9-24)  and earned the world number one ranking in that event.[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Lewis#cite_note-29)  _Track and Field News_  ranked him number two in the 200 m, despite his low-altitude record of 19.75 s, behind Smith, who had won gold at Helsinki.[[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Lewis#cite_note-200mranking-30)  Lewis was again named Athlete of the Year by the magazine.[[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Lewis#cite_note-AOTY-31)",

As the son of a steel worker, he began running as a 13-year-old, and soon showed astonishing talent as a junior. At the age of only 15 his personal best over 800 m stood at 1:51 min. After setting a junior  [world record](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_record \"World record\")  of 1:44.3 min in 1981, he received a scholarship for the  [University of Oregon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Oregon \"University of Oregon\")  in 1983. The move immediately paid off, and Cruz won the  [NCAA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Collegiate_Athletic_Association \"National Collegiate Athletic Association\")  championships over 800 m that same year. He also competed in the  [inaugural World Championships](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1983_World_Championships_in_Athletics \"1983 World Championships in Athletics\")  in 1983, winning the bronze.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joaquim_Cruz#cite_note-sr-1)[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joaquim_Cruz#cite_note-iaaf-2)\n\nThe following year, Cruz became one of only a handful of people to win the 800/1500 m double at the 1984 NCAA Track & Field Championships (a feat that would not be repeated for another 26 years until another Oregon Duck,  [Andrew Wheating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Wheating \"Andrew Wheating\"), turned the trick in 2010).

In the last turn of the 800 meter final, Cruz started a sprint from second place and took the lead, never losing it. He crossed the line in 1:43.00, breaking  [Alberto Juantorena](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alberto_Juantorena \"Alberto Juantorena\")'s Olympic Record and making him the first Brazilian Olympic track and field gold medalist since  [triple jumper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_jump \"Triple jump\")  [Adhemar Ferreira da Silva](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adhemar_Ferreira_da_Silva \"Adhemar Ferreira da Silva\")  won both in  [1952](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athletics_at_the_1952_Summer_Olympics \"Athletics at the 1952 Summer Olympics\")  and  [1956](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athletics_at_the_1956_Summer_Olympics \"Athletics at the 1956 Summer Olympics\").[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joaquim_Cruz#cite_note-sr-1)\n\nLater that week, after winning his first round heat of the Olympic 1500 m, Cruz, due to a cold, did not start in the semi-finals, which caused quite a stir among the Brazilians, who thought he didn't want to represent his country in an event in which his chances of winning were smaller. Cruz eventually recovered from his cold and had a remarkable five-day stretch of racing a few weeks after the Olympic Games. First, he ran a new Brazilian 800 m record of 1:42.34 at the Weltklasse meet in Zurich, becoming only the second runner in history to break 1:43. Two days later he ran a 1:42.41 at the  [Memorial Van Damme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memorial_Van_Damme \"Memorial Van Damme\")  meet in  [Brussels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brussels \"Brussels\"), and then two days after that, at a meeting in  [Cologne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cologne \"Cologne\"), Cruz ran the second fastest 800 meters in history, his time of 1:41.77 was only four hundredths of a second outside of Coe's world record. He is the fifth fastest athlete in the history of the event.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joaquim_Cruz#cite_note-4)  By the end of the year, he was the NCAA champion, the Olympic champion, undefeated in all seven of his 800-meter finals, had run the 2nd, 4th, 5th, and 6th fastest 800 meter times in history, and easily ranked as #1 in the world for 800 meters in 1984 by  [Track & Field News](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_%26_Field_News \"Track & Field News\")  magazine.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joaquim_Cruz#cite_note-sr-1)\n\nIn 1985 Cruz confirmed the excellent results of the previous year by winning six of his eight 800 meter races, the last three of which were won under 1:43: 1:42.98 at ISTAF, 1:42.53 in Cologne (beating Sebastian Coe), and 1:42.49 in Koblenz. His record was good enough to earn him a World #1 ranking by  _Track & Field News_  magazine for the second year in a row. He also ran the world's 3rd fastest 1,000 meter time for 1985, a 2:15.11. In the following two years he struggled with injuries and raced little, though he did manage to win the gold medal in the 1,500 meters at the  [1987 Pan American Games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1987_Pan_American_Games \"1987 Pan American Games\"), defeating both  [Jim Spivey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Spivey \"Jim Spivey\")  (who within the next month would win a bronze medal at the World Championships) and American mile record holder  [Steve Scott](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Scott_(athlete) \"Steve Scott (athlete)\").[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joaquim_Cruz#cite_note-sr-1)\n\nAt the  [1988 Summer Olympics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1988_Summer_Olympics \"1988 Summer Olympics\"), Cruz appeared to be on his way to retain his Olympic 800 m title when he was passed by  [Kenyan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenya \"Kenya\")  runner  [Paul Ereng](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Ereng \"Paul Ereng\"), leaving Cruz with the silver medal. Troubled by  [Achilles' tendon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achilles%27_tendon \"Achilles' tendon\")  injuries, Cruz was never again able to reach the international top level. In 1993, he tried to make a comeback and started over 1500 m at various Grand Prix races in Europe but failed to make a major impact. His last victory of significance came in the 1500 meters at the  [1995 Pan American Games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1995_Pan_American_Games \"1995 Pan American Games\"). One year later, taking part at his third Olympics at the  [1996 Summer Olympics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1996_Summer_Olympics \"1996 Summer Olympics\"), Cruz was the Brazilian flag-bearer and ran the 1500 meters without reaching the finals.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joaquim_Cruz#cite_note-sr-1)[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joaquim_Cruz#cite_note-5)\n\nCruz was a torchbearer and lit the flame cauldron at the  [2007 Pan American Games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_Pan_American_Games \"2007 Pan American Games\")  in  [Rio de Janeiro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rio_de_Janeiro \"Rio de Janeiro\"), on July 13, 2007. After retiring from competitions he became a running coach at the Olympic Training Center in  [Chula Vista, California](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chula_Vista,_California \"Chula Vista, California\").
